**Team Project – D.6 Implementation 2**

**Introduction**

Our system is called Pinecone, and it is a web application that will be useful for students when enrolling in classes at the university. Pinecone is an application that is used to inform NAU students and have a more efficient and user-friendly approach to class enrollment. In an attempt to improve upon LOUIE, Pinecone has a focus on simplifying and expediting the enrollment research process, allowing students to make well-informed decisions, and ultimately helping them avoid unnecessary hardships and confusion throughout the semester. It will accomplish this by displaying professor ratings for each course in addition to class distribution data, so they can see how previous students performed in the class. It also allows students to see which courses fulfill their graduation requirements and automatically creates a calendar file for students to export into a calendar of their choosing.

**Tests**Test framework you used to develop your tests: Jest\
[Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/tree/main/Testing)\
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.

There are three repositories to test three different things: [Instructor's Information](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/tree/main/Testing/InstructorInfo), [Class Information](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/tree/main/Testing/classInfo) and [Comments for the Instructor](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/tree/main/Testing/commentArr). Every test is based on the same [file](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/blob/main/Testing/commentArr/Prototype.js) testing a different object in the system. .\

**Code quality**

**Format:** Brackets on a single line, proper indentation to increase readability, spacing.

**Conventions:** 

- Use one bracket to rule them all format and adequate white space
- Name functions and variables after their purpose or use. 

**Policies:** 

- Don’t mess with other people’s code unless it’s an improvement.
- Don't update code directly, create pull requests so someone can review your work. 

**Best Practices:** Add a comment for every section of code. Explain what it is doing in a sentence.

**Lessons learned**

The team learned that we all have a serious case of procrastination but we can get a lot done in a short amount of time. If we continue working on the project we would like to set up the database before starting on the frontend and have a better assignment of roles. We think as we warmed up to github over the course of this project, we learned a lot about how it can keep our workflow organized and allow us to update changes made so that everyone can see and approve them before they go live in our final build.
