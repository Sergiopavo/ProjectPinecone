**Deliverable 4: Implementation 1**

**Introduction**Our system is called Pinecone, and it is a web application that will be useful for students when enrolling in classes at the university. Pinecone is an application that is used to inform NAU students and have a more efficient and user-friendly approach to class enrollment. In an attempt to improve upon LOUIE, Pinecone has a focus on simplifying and expediting the enrollment research process, allowing students to make well-informed decisions, and ultimately helping them avoid unnecessary hardships and confusion throughout the semester. It will accomplish this by displaying professor ratings for each course in addition to class distribution data, so they can see how previous students performed in the class. It also allows students to see which courses fulfill their graduation requirements and automatically creates a calendar file for students to export into a calendar of their choosing. Here is a link to Pinecone’s GitHub: https\://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone

**Tests**

****You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests: Jest\
[Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/tree/main/Testing)\
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.

Input for this [File](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/blob/main/project_pinecone/assets/js/Prototype.js) was being tested by this [test](https://github.com/UnlimitedDrip/ProjectPinecone/blob/main/Testing/Prototype.test.js).\

**Adopted technologies**

**List the adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.**

**Programming languages**

- JavaScript - Used for handling database and user input
- CSS - Website formatting and GUI
- C - (pending)
- HTML - Main website functionality

GitHub is the main hub for all our files, code, and overall application progress. An essential tool that the vast majority of programmers use in their professional work

FileZilla is being used to upload website files to the server that hosts our website. Easy to pick up and simple to use, in addition to being a technology most, if not all, of us have used before.

Host winds: server host for our website. It was also used earlier in our curriculum and is also fairly easy already, in addition to already being used for a different class.

Google Drive is being used for synchronous work on deliverables, reports, activity trackers, etc. It’s just generally extremely easy to get on board with, as it not only makes file sharing extremely easy but also guarantees everyone is already set up to use it with our NAU emails.

Jest: potential candidate for testing. Rated well in early research, it may be subject to change based on whether we decide we like it or not.

MochaJs: Another potential candidate for testing very similarly, it came up pretty early with positive feedback but could also be replaced later.

**Learning/training**

We approached our learning and training by dividing up the work. Each member of the team would choose a different topic to learn about, and then we would present and share what we learned during our group meetings. If someone was having a difficult time, the whole group would stop and attempt to solve the problem by helping each other understand.

This would ensure everyone had a basic understanding of each technology we used, and the whole team would provide support and work together when someone had a question.

**Deployment**Provide a link for the system in production and describe how you are deploying your system. 

<http://wewladitreal.com/pinecone/>

We are deploying our system on TJ’s website under a subdirectory, it is being hosted on a host winds.

**Licensing**For our license, we selected the MIT License because it suited our needs as a team, and we want people to be able to modify our project or create their own versions of our project.

**Look & feel**During the development process for the user interface, there was a clear focus on creating a clean, modern, and simple interface that created an easy-to-use environment for the user. Our goal was to make it intuitive so that anyone could use our product without feeling overwhelmed or confused. We broke down the website into 3 different sections: a homepage, an about section, and a section to create a calendar file.

**Navigation Bar:**

****![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NXtNIcZx6HGqlt2duNw8uzDLXuinRoZdEMjWRRUwZZHGnTQjkvM2nZcKHhzgoFbSshy_79ybeDYLMXy1qvOfrAbugHtfpxeKq7QzIs0RiiVmH-zh9D-3c8MHoGwcZM82nAPXe-WIhiFL00LOxZwIqdI)****

The design of our navigation bar had the clear intention of being efficient and pleasing to the eye. The three tabs are centered for user comfort, and using CSS, there are button animations when you hover over each tab, respectively. This gives the navigation bar a very modern and responsive feel.

**Homepage:** The homepage features a simple welcome message. For now, we have a place where you can get some information about any particular professor or class, with some data about the professor from Rate My Professor, and a percentage of students who passed with a C or higher.

**Create:** The Creates section currently has a tile with an interactive button that allows you to import an ICS file directly from your computer. The button has an animation that transitions colors slightly when interacted with.

**About:** The about section will feature a little more about our team behind the project, as well as the mission and motive that visitors to the website can read about.

**Lessons learned**

We worked really well together, to the point where we managed to complete most of the features in a single week. For the second release, we plan to implement a database to store our information, possibly use an API for retrieving data, and add more useful features to our website. We also need a more organized workflow, since we all panicked for this and did everything at the last minute. We will be using our agile development workflow software more and assigning a team leader, so we have a clear understanding of what should be done every week.
