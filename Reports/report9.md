### **1. Summary of activities**

Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. 

**Aaron -** I have researched a little bit about SQL and how to connect it to the website. Planned a testing period with Sergio. 

**TJ -** I finished the code of conduct file, did some mild work on the HTML files and pushed the updated files to the server

**Daniel -** I continued further implementation of the website design and layout, following a set of principles in my design choices so that the user has an easy and intuitive experience. 

**Sergio -** I have been investigating how to connect our database in MySQL to our website and found PHP, which might be the best approach for this. 

### **2. Project retrospective**

**Retrospective:** We feel like we have a good product going and are adding ideas to the website and are hopeful that everything will be complete by this December. 

1. **Appreciations:** This week was quiet, and we were all able to agree on starting the deliverable early. 

2. **Successes:** Our main idea for the project has already been implemented

3. **Failures:** None

4. **Barriers:** 

   1. Other school obligations, it's still the middle of the semester. 
   2. Finding time to work on this project over others 

5. **What we should try next time:** Creating a temporary new meeting time to get the deliverable done.
