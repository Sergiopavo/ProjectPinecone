### **1. Summary of activities**

Each member reports on their activities since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. 

**Aaron -** I have researched a little bit about SQL and how to connect it to the website. Planned a testing period with Sergio. 

**TJ -** I finished the code of conduct file, did some mild work on the HTML files and pushed the updated files to the server

**Daniel -** I continued further implementation of the website design and layout, following a set of principles in my design choices so that the user has an easy and intuitive experience. 

**Sergio -** I have been investigating how to connect our database in MySQL to our website and found PHP, which might be the best approach for this.
