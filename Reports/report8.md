### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron** - I implemented the feature that allows us to show class distribution data by creating and filling a temporary JavaScript file while attempting to troubleshoot are database issues. I also helped troubleshoot some GitHub issues, checked and verified some code that was requested to be pulled onto the main.

**Sergio -** I implemented the feature that shows the Instructor's information by using JavaScript to find an instructor from an array with the Instructor’s information in the form of an object. And made the necessary changes to the HTML to facilitate the interactions between the website’s input and the output from the JavaScript.

**Daniel** - I Built up the entire foundation of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes three different tabs including a homepage, create section, and about section for users who want to learn more about the project. Using CSS, I was able to accomplish a simple, intuitive design that is modern and easily approachable for any user. I then created a JavaScript file that allows users to import an .ICS file from their computer. With the foundation of the website complete, that made building on the other elements a smoother process.

**TJ** - Frontend hosting and early testing for exporting .ICS file. Otherwise, trying to pick up scraps of stuff to do amidst one of my more busy weeks.
