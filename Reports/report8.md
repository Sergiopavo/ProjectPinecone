### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron** - I implemented the feature that allows us to show class distribution data by creating and filling a temporary JavaScript file while attempting to troubleshoot are database issues. I also helped troubleshoot some GitHub issues, checked and verified some code that was requested to be pulled onto the main.

**Sergio -** I implemented the feature that shows the Instructor's information by using JavaScript to find an instructor from an array with the Instructor’s information in the form of an object. And made the necessary changes to the HTML to facilitate the interactions between the website’s input and the output from the JavaScript.

**Daniel** - I Built up the entire foundation of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes three different tabs including a homepage, create section, and about section for users who want to learn more about the project. Using CSS, I was able to accomplish a simple, intuitive design that is modern and easily approachable for any user. I then created a JavaScript file that allows users to import an .ICS file from their computer. With the foundation of the website complete, that made building on the other elements a smoother process.

**TJ** - Frontend hosting and early testing for exporting .ICS file. Otherwise, trying to pick up scraps of stuff to do amidst one of my more busy weeks. 

### 2. Project retrospective

**Retrospective:** This week went alright because we all locked in and got a prototype working for our project. We established a very good foundation with the web application. 

1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members

- Daniel really saved us by creating the foundation for our web application.
- Sergio Implemented the main feature of our project really quickly.

2. Successes: what went well

- We have a solid base for our project and seem to have the fundamentals at a functional state
- The overall website layout seems to be approved by all team members
- The main feature of our product works as intended. 

3. Failures: what did not go well

   1. We severely overestimated the amount of time we had to work on the project.

4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team

- Other school obligations, it's still the middle of the semester. 
- Finding time to work on this project over others 

5. What we should try next time. 

   1. Managing our time better and get more comfortable with GitHub. 

**Ideas Discussed:** TJ wants a better task assignment for team members. Aaron wants to focus on setting up the database to work with the application. 

Setting up of Light Deadlines: Wed, check up in Discord on current progress.
