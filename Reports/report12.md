### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron -** I gave the team report/check in to the professor and communicated the team’s fallbacks with the team. I also researched Django implementation in regard to our current project.

**TJ -** I succeeded in learning how all of the code works together, but otherwise struggled against the motivation to add to it in a meaningful way. I researched how I could make allow the website to maintain data between pages, but did not land on anything concrete.

**Daniel -** Wrapped up the last of the website design and layout features with the exception of the calendar section as I am waiting on the rest of my team in order to implement that correctly. Organized my code a little bit to make it easier to read and commented out sections that I thought needed context in terms of what the piece of code is accomplishing.

**Sergio -** I been doing research for Django since Aaron informed me that we need a backend framework.

**2. Project retrospective**

**Retrospective:** 

1. **Appreciations: Everyone**
2. **Successes:** **We’ve been conducting a decent amount of research on how to implement django to our project**
3. **Failures: Not much progress was made this week on the project.**
4. **Barriers: Time and Ignorance. This week is Thanksgiving and most of our members traveled to their hometowns preventing us from making progress on the project.**
5. **What we should try next time: Implement Django into our current project**

**Ideas Discussed: Implementing FLASK instead of Django**

### 3. Next steps

**Aaron** — I will add Django to the GitHub and our web application to hopefully facilitate an easier integration with MySQL.

**TJ** - I was initially assigned the final set of steps to combine all the work of my teammates to make all functionality work together, I’m realizing now that this task is more overwhelming than I initially thought it’d be. Nonetheless, I will still do my best to finish what I can

**Daniel** - My plan at this point is to prepare to deploy our product while also working alongside my teammates to help them complete whatever tasks they have left, and also wrap up the calendar section of our project and assist however I can with the website design. 

**Sergio** - I will help the other team members with anything they need, especially Aaron, with the implementation of Django in our project.
