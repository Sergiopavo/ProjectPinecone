### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron -** I reviewed my old PHP projects and made a prototype that I believe should work for our project. I also completed my part of the deliverable on Monday. 

**TJ -** I updated the class diagram to represent how the system is working/planned to be working by the end of the project. I am also still waiting to a smaller extent to see how data gets returned for the sake beginning implementation of an export function

**Daniel -** Continued further interface development on the website, updated our about section to better reflect our project goals and objectives as well as providing information about each team member. I also worked extensively on the calendar section of our website so that the calendar is formatted correctly on the web page. I continued to uphold the modern and clean design that feels seamless and is easy to use.

**Sergio -** Worked on solving one of the issues from GitHub and started planning the calendar part of the project.
