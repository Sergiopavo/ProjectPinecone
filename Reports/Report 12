### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron -** I gave the team report/check in to the professor and communicated the teamâ€™s fallbacks with the team. I also researched Django implementation in regard to our current project.

**TJ -** I succeeded in learning how all of the code works together, but otherwise struggled against the motivation to add to it in a meaningful way. I researched how I could make allow the website to maintain data between pages, but did not land on anything concrete.

**Daniel -** Wrapped up the last of the website design and layout features with the exception of the calendar section as I am waiting on the rest of my team in order to implement that correctly. Organized my code a little bit to make it easier to read and commented out sections that I thought needed context in terms of what the piece of code is accomplishing.

**Sergio -** I been doing research for Django since Aaron informed me that we need a backend framework.
