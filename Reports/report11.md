### **1. Summary of activities**

**Aaron -** I implemented 2 new features so we could resolve some of the issues on our github. I also added data to the Javascript file itself to serve as a backup for the database. I also helped sergio insert values into the database.

**TJ -** I struggled to bounce back from a week of low sleep, but am going to dedicate the weekend to working on saving database search info into arrays, adding a dropdown with classes on the create page and the export functionality

**Daniel -** my plans this week with the website being mostly complete was to just go back and fix any visual or interface bugs that were present in the system. An example of this being the tiles I created in our information section of the homepage not adapting based on the amount of text that is present in the tile at the moment. 

**Sergio -** Created the database in Mysql with two tables one containing comments for the professors and the other one containing the data information for the class data.
